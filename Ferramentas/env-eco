Manage Environment Variables with Eco

Eco CLI may be installed globally or on a per-project basis using Composer:

$ composer require hotmeteor/eco-cli
 
$ composer global require hotmeteor/eco-cli

Once you have the initial setup completed, you could get a fresh .env (based on .env.example) using the following CLI command:

eco env:fresh

You can push/pull env from the remote .eco file using:

# Pull a remote key/value pair from the remote .eco file
eco env:pull

# Push a key/value pair to the remote eco file
eco env:push

Getting Started

Once Eco is installed it needs to be set up. Ideally, this is done within the folder for the project you are collaborating on.

A Github Personal Access Token is required. It should be created with the repo and read:org permissions.

$ eco init

You will be asked to select the owner or organization to act under, as well as the repository for the current project.
Usage

Eco comes with a number of commands to manage local and remote environment variables.
Setup

$ eco init

Should be the first thing you run after installing. As seen above, it requires a Github PAT.
Organizations

$ eco org:switch

List available organizations you're a member of and allow you switch to a different one.

$ eco org:current

Show the current working organization.
Repositories

$ eco repo:list

List available repositories in your organization.

$ eco repo:switch

List available repositories in your organization and allow you switch to a different repo. This allows you to use Eco across different repositories. Just don't forget to switch repos before pushing or pulling!

$ eco repo:current

Show the current working repository.
Keys

$ eco env:fresh

Fetch the .env.example file from your project repository and copy it as your new local .env file. This is a desctructive command, so you are asked to confirm.

$ eco env:set

Create or update a key:value pair in your local vault and will add it to your local .env file.

$ eco env:unset

Remove a key:value pair from your local vault and will remove it from your local .env file.

$ eco env:push

Push a key:value pair into the remote .eco file.

$ eco env:pull

Fetch a key:value pair from the remote .eco file and add or update it in your local .env file.
