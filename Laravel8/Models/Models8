Model factory classes
Class-based factories have replaced the model factories we knew before.

Laravel 7
/**
 * Run the database seeds.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function run()
{
    factory(App\User::class, 50)->create()->each(function ($user) {
        $user->posts()->save(factory(App\Post::class)->make());
    });
}
Laravel 8
use App\Models\User;/**
 * Run the database seeders.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function run()
{
    User::factory()
            ->times(50)
            ->hasPosts(1)
            ->create();
}
